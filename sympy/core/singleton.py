    Metaclass for singleton classes.

    A singleton class has only one instance which is returned every time the
    class is instantiated. Additionally, this instance can be accessed through
    the global registry object S as S.<class_name>.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import S, Basic
    >>> from sympy.core.singleton import Singleton
    >>> class MySingleton(Basic, metaclass=Singleton):
    ...     pass
    >>> Basic() is Basic()
    False
    >>> MySingleton() is MySingleton()
    True
    >>> S.MySingleton is MySingleton()
    True

    Notes
    =====

    Instance creation is delayed until the first time the value is accessed.

    This metaclass is a subclass of ManagedProperties because that is the
    metaclass of many classes that need to be Singletons (Python does not allow
    subclasses to have a different metaclass than the superclass, except the
    subclass may use a subclassed metaclass).
