        * Nothing heroic is done in this implicit solving so you may end up
          with a symbol still in the solution:

        * if you attempt to solve for a number remember that the number
          you have obtained does not necessarily mean that the value is
          equivalent to the expression obtained:

    Notes
    =====

    assumptions aren't checked when `solve()` input involves
    relationals or bools.

    When the solutions are checked, those that make any denominator zero
    are automatically excluded. If you do not want to exclude such solutions
    then use the check=False option:

        >>> from sympy import sin, limit
        >>> solve(sin(x)/x)  # 0 is excluded
        [pi]

    If check=False then a solution to the numerator being zero is found: x = 0.
    In this case, this is a spurious solution since sin(x)/x has the well known
    limit (without dicontinuity) of 1 at x = 0:

        >>> solve(sin(x)/x, check=False)
        [0, pi]

    In the following case, however, the limit exists and is equal to the the
    value of x = 0 that is excluded when check=True:

        >>> eq = x**2*(1/x - z**2/x)
        >>> solve(eq, x)
        []
        >>> solve(eq, x, check=False)
        [0]
        >>> limit(eq, x, 0, '-')
        0
        >>> limit(eq, x, 0, '+')
        0

    Disabling high-order, explicit solutions
    ----------------------------------------

    When solving polynomial expressions, one might not want explicit solutions
    (which can be quite long). If the expression is univariate, RootOf
    instances will be returned instead:

        >>> solve(x**3 - x + 1)
        [-1/((-1/2 - sqrt(3)*I/2)*(3*sqrt(69)/2 + 27/2)**(1/3)) - (-1/2 -
        sqrt(3)*I/2)*(3*sqrt(69)/2 + 27/2)**(1/3)/3, -(-1/2 +
        sqrt(3)*I/2)*(3*sqrt(69)/2 + 27/2)**(1/3)/3 - 1/((-1/2 +
        sqrt(3)*I/2)*(3*sqrt(69)/2 + 27/2)**(1/3)), -(3*sqrt(69)/2 +
        27/2)**(1/3)/3 - 1/(3*sqrt(69)/2 + 27/2)**(1/3)]
        >>> solve(x**3 - x + 1, cubics=False)
        [RootOf(x**3 - x + 1, 0), RootOf(x**3 - x + 1, 1), RootOf(x**3 - x + 1, 2)]

        If the expression is multivariate, no solution might be returned:

        >>> solve(x**3 - x + a, x, cubics=False)
        []

    Sometimes solutions will be obtained even when a flag is False because the
    expression could be factored. In the following example, the equation can
    be factored as the product of a linear and a quadratic factor so explicit
    solutions (which did not require solving a cubic expression) are obtained:

        >>> eq = x**3 + 3*x**2 + x - 1
        >>> solve(eq, cubics=False)
        [-1, -1 + sqrt(2), -sqrt(2) - 1]

    Solving equations involving radicals
    ------------------------------------

    Because of SymPy's use of the principle root (issue #8789), some solutions
    to radical equations will be missed unless check=False:

        >>> from sympy import root
        >>> eq = root(x**3 - 3*x**2, 3) + 1 - x
        >>> solve(eq)
        []
        >>> solve(eq, check=False)
        [1/3]

    In the above example there is only a single solution to the equation. Other
    expressions will yield spurious roots which must be checked manually;
    roots which give a negative argument to odd-powered radicals will also need
    special checking:

        >>> from sympy import real_root, Rational
        >>> eq = root(x, 3) - root(x, 5) + Rational(1, 7)
        >>> solve(eq)  # this gives 2 solutions but misses a 3rd
        [RootOf(7*_p**5 - 7*_p**3 + 1, 1)**15,
        RootOf(7*_p**5 - 7*_p**3 + 1, 2)**15]
        >>> sol = solve(eq, check=False)
        >>> [abs(eq.subs(x,i).n(2)) for i in sol]
        [0.48, 0.e-110, 0.e-110, 0.052, 0.052]

        The first solution is negative so real_root must be used to see that
        it satisfies the expression:

        >>> abs(real_root(eq.subs(x, sol[0])).n(2))
        0.e-110

    If the roots of the equation are not real then more care will be necessary
    to find the roots, especially for higher order equations. Consider the
    following expression:

        >>> expr = root(x, 3) - root(x, 5)

    We will construct a known value for this expression at x = 3 by selecting
    the 1-th root for each radical:

        >>> expr1 = root(x, 3, 1) - root(x, 5, 1)
        >>> v = expr1.subs(x, -3)

    The solve function is unable to find any exact roots to this equation:

        >>> eq = Eq(expr, v); eq1 = Eq(expr1, v)
        >>> solve(eq, check=False), solve(eq1, check=False)
        ([], [])

    The function unrad, however, can be used to get a form of the equation for
    which numerical roots can be found:

        >>> from sympy.solvers.solvers import unrad
        >>> from sympy import nroots, pprint
        >>> e, (p, cov) = unrad(eq)
        >>> pvals = nroots(e)
        >>> inversion = solve(cov, x)[0]
        >>> xvals = [inversion.subs(p, i) for i in pvals]

    Although eq or eq1 could have been used to find xvals, the solution can
    only be verified with expr1:

        >>> z = expr - v
        >>> [xi.n(chop=1e-9) for xi in xvals if abs(z.subs(x, xi).n()) < 1e-9]
        []
        >>> z1 = expr1 - v
        >>> pprint([xi.n(chop=1e-9) for xi in xvals if abs(z1.subs(x, xi).n()) < 1e-9])
        [-3.0]

        (numerator, denominator) of ``f``
            If this comes back as (0, 1) it means
            that ``f`` is independent of the symbols in ``symbols``, e.g::

                y*cos(x)**2 + y*sin(x)**2 - y = y*(0) = 0
                cos(x)**2 + sin(x)**2 = 1

            If it comes back as (0, 0) there is no solution to the equation
            amongst the symbols given.

            If the numerator is not zero then the function is guaranteed
            to be dependent on a symbol in ``symbols``.

        or

        (symbol, solution) where symbol appears linearly in the numerator of
        ``f``, is in ``symbols`` (if given) and is not in ``exclude`` (if given).

        No simplification is done to ``f`` other than and mul=True expansion,
        so the solution will correspond strictly to a unique solution.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.solvers.solvers import solve_linear
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z

    These are linear in x and 1/x:

    >>> solve_linear(x + y**2)
    (x, -y**2)
    >>> solve_linear(1/x - y**2)
    (x, y**(-2))

    When not linear in x or y then the numerator and denominator are returned.

    >>> solve_linear(x**2/y**2 - 3)
    (x**2 - 3*y**2, y**2)

    If the numerator is a symbol then (0, 0) is returned if the solution for
    that symbol would have set any denominator to 0:

    >>> solve_linear(1/(1/x - 2))
    (0, 0)
    >>> 1/(1/x)  # to SymPy, this looks like x ...
    x
    >>> solve_linear(1/(1/x))  # so a solution is given
    (x, 0)

    If x is allowed to cancel, then this appears linear, but this sort of
    cancellation is not done so the solution will always satisfy the original
    expression without causing a division by zero error.

    >>> solve_linear(x**2*(1/x - z**2/x))
    (x**2*(-z**2 + 1), x)

    You can give a list of what you prefer for x candidates:

    >>> solve_linear(x + y + z, symbols=[y])
    (y, -x - z)

    You can also indicate what variables you don't want to consider:

    >>> solve_linear(x + y + z, exclude=[x, z])
    (y, -x - z)

    If only x was excluded then a solution for y or z might be obtained.

def solve_linear_system(system, *symbols, **flags):
    r"""
    Solve system of N linear equations with M variables, which means
    both under- and overdetermined systems are supported. The possible
    number of solutions is zero, one or infinite. Respectively, this
    procedure will return None or a dictionary with solutions. In the
    case of underdetermined systems, all arbitrary parameters are skipped.
    This may cause a situation in which an empty dictionary is returned.
    In that case, all symbols can be assigned arbitrary values.

    Input to this functions is a Nx(M+1) matrix, which means it has
    to be in augmented form. If you prefer to enter N equations and M
    unknowns then use `solve(Neqs, *Msymbols)` instead. Note: a local
    copy of the matrix is made by this routine so the matrix that is
    passed will not be modified.

    The algorithm used here is fraction-free Gaussian elimination,
    which results, after elimination, in an upper-triangular matrix.
    Then solutions are found using back-substitution. This approach
    is more efficient and compact than the Gauss-Jordan method.

def nsolve(*args, **kwargs):
    r"""
    Solve a nonlinear equation system numerically::

        nsolve(f, [args,] x0, modules=['mpmath'], **kwargs)

    f is a vector function of symbolic expressions representing the system.
    args are the variables. If there is only one variable, this argument can
    be omitted.
    x0 is a starting vector close to a solution.

    Use the modules keyword to specify which modules should be used to
    evaluate the function and the Jacobian matrix. Make sure to use a module
    that supports matrices. For more information on the syntax, please see the
    docstring of lambdify.

    Overdetermined systems are supported.

    >>> from sympy import Symbol, nsolve
    >>> import sympy
    >>> import mpmath
    >>> mpmath.mp.dps = 15
    >>> x1 = Symbol('x1')
    >>> x2 = Symbol('x2')
    >>> f1 = 3 * x1**2 - 2 * x2**2 - 1

    For one-dimensional functions the syntax is simplified:

    >>> from sympy import sin, nsolve
    >>> from sympy.abc import x
    >>> print(nsolve(sin(x), x, 2))
    3.14159265358979
    >>> print(nsolve(sin(x), 2))
    3.14159265358979

    mpmath.findroot is used, you can find there more extensive documentation,
    especially concerning keyword parameters and available solvers. Note,
    however, that this routine works only with the numerator of the function
    in the one-dimensional case, and for very steep functions near the root
    this may lead to a failure in the verification of the root. In this case

    NotImplementedError is raised if there are radicals and they cannot be
    removed or if the relationship between the original symbols and the
    change of variable needed to rewrite the system as a polynomial cannot
    be solved.

    Otherwise the tuple, ``(eq, cov)``, is returned where::

        ``eq``, ``cov``
            ``eq`` is an equation without radicals (in the symbol(s) of
            interest) whose solutions are a superset of the solutions to the
            original expression. ``eq`` might be re-written in terms of a new
            variable; the relationship to the original variables is given by
            ``cov`` which is a list containing ``v`` and ``v**p - b`` where
            ``p`` is the power needed to clear the radical and ``b`` is the
            radical now expressed as a polynomial in the symbols of interest.
            For example, for sqrt(2 - x) the tuple would be
            ``(c, c**2 - 2 + x)``. The solutions of ``eq`` will contain
            solutions to the original equation (if there are any).

    ``syms``
        an iterable of symbols which, if provided, will limit the focus of
        radical removal: only radicals with one or more of the symbols of
        interest will be cleared. All free symbols are used if ``syms`` is not
        set.

    ``flags`` are used internally for communication during recursive calls.
    Two options are also recognized::

        ``take``, when defined, is interpreted as a single-argument function
        that returns True if a given Pow should be handled.

    Radicals can be removed from an expression if::

        *   all bases of the radicals are the same; a change of variables is
            done in this case.
        *   if all radicals appear in one term of the expression
        *   there are only 4 terms with sqrt() factors or there are less than
            four terms having sqrt() factors
        *   there are only two terms with radicals
