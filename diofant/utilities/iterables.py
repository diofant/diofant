    ``graph`` : ``tuple[list, list[tuple[T, T]]``
        A tuple consisting of a list of vertices and a list of edges of

    ``key`` : ``callable[T]`` (optional)
        Ordering key for vertices on the same level. By default the natural
        (e.g. lexicographic) ordering is used (in this case the base type

        >>> topological_sort((V, E))
        [3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 2, 9, 10]

    If specific tie breaking approach is needed, use ``key`` parameter::

        [7, 5, 11, 3, 10, 8, 9, 2]

    Notes
    =====

    This algorithm is similar to, and solves the same problem as,
    Algorithm 7.2.1.5H, from volume 4A of Knuth's The Art of Computer
    Programming.  Knuth uses the term "restricted growth string" where
    this code refers to a "partition vector". In each case, the meaning is
    the same: the value in the ith element of the vector specifies to
    which part the ith set element is to be assigned.

    At the lowest level, this code implements an n-digit big-endian
    counter (stored in the array q) which is incremented (with carries) to
    get the next partition in the sequence.  A special twist is that a
    digit is constrained to be at most one greater than the maximum of all
    the digits to the left of it.  The array p maintains this maximum, so
    that the code can efficiently decide when a digit can be incremented
    in place or whether it needs to be reset to 0 and trigger a carry to
    the next digit.  The enumeration starts with all the digits 0 (which
    corresponds to all the set elements being assigned to the same 0th
    part), and ends with 0123...n, which corresponds to each set element
    being assigned to a different, singleton, part.

    This routine was rewritten to use 0-based lists while trying to
    preserve the beauty and efficiency of the original algorithm.

    """
    Return unique partitions of the given multiset (in list form).
    If ``m`` is None, all multisets will be returned, otherwise only
    partitions with ``m`` parts will be returned.

    If ``multiset`` is an integer, a range [0, 1, ..., multiset - 1]
    will be supplied.

    *Counting*

    The number of partitions of a set is given by the bell number:

    >>> len(list(multiset_partitions(5))) == bell(5) == 52
    True

    The number of partitions of length k from a set of size n is given by the
    Stirling Number of the 2nd kind:

    >>> def s2(n, k):
    ...     from diofant import Dummy, Sum, binomial, factorial
    ...     if k > n:
    ...         return 0

    ...     arg = (-1)**(k-j)*j**n*binomial(k, j)
    ...     return 1/factorial(k)*Sum(arg, (j, 0, k)).doit()
    ...
    >>> s2(5, 2) == len(list(multiset_partitions(5, 2))) == 15
    True

    These comments on counting apply to *sets*, not multisets.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> list(multiset_partitions([1, 2, 3, 4], 2))

    [[1], [2, 3, 4]]]
    >>> list(multiset_partitions([1, 2, 3, 4], 1))
    [[[1, 2, 3, 4]]]

    Only unique partitions are returned and these will be returned in a
    canonical order regardless of the order of the input:

    >>> a = [1, 2, 2, 1]
    >>> ans = list(multiset_partitions(a, 2))
    >>> a.sort()
    >>> list(multiset_partitions(a, 2)) == ans
    True
    >>> a = range(3, 1, -1)
    >>> (list(multiset_partitions(a)) ==
    ...  list(multiset_partitions(sorted(a))))
    True

    If m is omitted then all partitions will be returned:

    >>> list(multiset_partitions([1, 1, 2]))
    [[[1, 1, 2]], [[1, 1], [2]], [[1, 2], [1]], [[1], [1], [2]]]
    >>> list(multiset_partitions([1]*3))
    [[[1, 1, 1]], [[1], [1, 1]], [[1], [1], [1]]]

    Notes
    =====

    When all the elements are the same in the multiset, the order
    of the returned partitions is determined by the ``partitions``
    routine. If one is counting partitions then it is better to use
    the ``nT`` function.

    Parameters
    ==========

    ``m`` : integer (default gives partitions of all sizes)
        limits number of parts in partition (mnemonic: m, maximum parts).
        Default value, None, gives partitions from 1 through n.
    ``k`` : integer (default gives partitions number from 1 through n)
        limits the numbers that are kept in the partition (mnemonic: k, keys)
    ``size`` : bool (default False, only partition is returned)
        when ``True`` then (M, P) is returned where M is the sum of the
        multiplicities and P is the generated partition.

    Each partition is represented as a dictionary, mapping an integer
    to the number of copies of that integer in the partition.  For example,
    the first partition of 4 returned is {4: 1}, "4: one of them".

    Examples
    ========

    The numbers appearing in the partition (the key of the returned dict)
    are limited with k:

    >>> from diofant.utilities.iterables import partitions

    >>> for p in partitions(6, k=2):
    ...     print(p)
    {2: 3}
    {2: 2, 1: 2}
    {2: 1, 1: 4}
    {1: 6}

    The maximum number of parts in the partition (the sum of the values in
    the returned dict) are limited with m:

    >>> for p in partitions(6, m=2):
    ...     print(p)
    ...
    {6: 1}
    {5: 1, 1: 1}
    {4: 1, 2: 1}
    {3: 2}

    Note that the _same_ dictionary object is returned each time.
    This is for speed:  generating each partition goes quickly,
    taking constant time, independent of n.

    >>> list(partitions(6, k=2))
    [{1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}]

    If you want to build a list of the returned dictionaries then
    make a copy of them:

    >>> [p.copy() for p in partitions(6, k=2)]
    [{2: 3}, {1: 2, 2: 2}, {1: 4, 2: 1}, {1: 6}]
    >>> [(M, p.copy()) for M, p in partitions(6, k=2, size=True)]

def ordered_partitions(n, m=None, sort=True):
    """Generates ordered partitions of integer ``n``.

    Parameters
    ==========

    ``m`` : int or None, optional
        By default (None) gives partitions of all sizes, else only
        those with size m. In addition, if ``m`` is not None then
        partitions are generated *in place* (see examples).
    ``sort`` : bool, optional
        Controls whether partitions are
        returned in sorted order (default) when ``m`` is not None; when False,
        the partitions are returned as fast as possible with elements
        sorted, but when m|n the partitions will not be in
        ascending lexicographical order.

    Examples
    ========

    All partitions of 5 in ascending lexicographical:

    >>> for p in ordered_partitions(5):
    ...     print(p)
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    [1, 1, 1, 2]
    [1, 1, 3]
    [1, 2, 2]
    [1, 4]
    [2, 3]
    [5]

    Only partitions of 5 with two parts:

    >>> for p in ordered_partitions(5, 2):
    ...     print(p)
    [1, 4]
    [2, 3]

    When ``m`` is given, a given list objects will be used more than
    once for speed reasons so you will not see the correct partitions
    unless you make a copy of each as it is generated:

    >>> list(ordered_partitions(7, 3))
    [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]
    >>> [list(p) for p in ordered_partitions(7, 3)]
    [[1, 1, 5], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 3], [2, 2, 3]]

    When ``n`` is a multiple of ``m``, the elements are still sorted
    but the partitions themselves will be *unordered* if sort is False;
    the default is to return them in ascending lexicographical order.

    >>> for p in ordered_partitions(6, 2):
    ...     print(p)
    [1, 5]
    [2, 4]
    [3, 3]

    False:

    sorted on the basis of the decoration (e.g. making all letters lower
    case) and then undecorated. If one wants to break ties for items that
    have the same decorated value, a second key can be used. But if the
    second key is expensive to compute then it is inefficient to decorate
    all items with both keys: only those items having identical first key
    values need to be decorated. This function applies keys successively
    only when needed to break ties. By yielding an iterator, use of the
    tie-breaker is delayed as long as possible.

    This function is best used in cases when use of the first key is
    expected to be a good hashing function; if there are no unique hashes
    from application of a key then that key should not have been used. The
    exception, however, is that even if there are many collisions, if the
    first group is small and one does not need to process all items in the
    list then time will not be wasted sorting what one was not interested
    in. For example, if one were looking for the minimum in a list and
    there were several criteria used to define the sort order, then this
    function would be good at returning that quickly if the first group
    of candidates is small relative to the number of items being processed.

    """
    Return a key that can be used for sorting.

    The key has the structure:

    (class_key, (len(args), args), exponent.sort_key(), coefficient)

    This key is supplied by the sort_key routine of Basic objects when
    ``item`` is a Basic object or an object (other than a string) that
    sympifies to a Basic object. Otherwise, this function produces the
    key.

    The ``order`` argument is passed along to the sort_key routine and is
    used to determine how the terms *within* an expression are ordered.
    (See examples below) ``order`` options are: 'lex', 'grlex', 'grevlex',
    and reversed values of the same (e.g. 'rev-lex'). The default order
    value is None (which translates to 'lex').

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from diofant.core.function import UndefinedFunction

    The following are equivalent ways of getting the key for an object:

    >>> x.sort_key() == default_sort_key(x)
    True

    Here are some examples of the key that is produced:

    >>> default_sort_key(UndefinedFunction('f'))
    ((0, 0, 'UndefinedFunction'), (1, ('f',)), ((1, 0, 'Number'),
        (0, ()), (), 1), 1)
    >>> default_sort_key('1')
    ((0, 0, 'str'), (1, ('1',)), ((1, 0, 'Number'), (0, ()), (), 1), 1)
    >>> default_sort_key(Integer(1))
    ((1, 0, 'Number'), (0, ()), (), 1)
    >>> default_sort_key(2)
    ((1, 0, 'Number'), (0, ()), (), 2)

    While sort_key is a method only defined for Diofant objects,
    default_sort_key will accept anything as an argument so it is
    more robust as a sorting key. For the following, using key=
    lambda i: i.sort_key() would fail because 2 doesn't have a sort_key
    method; that's why default_sort_key is used. Note, that it also
    handles sympification of non-string items likes ints:

    >>> a = [2, I, -I]
    >>> sorted(a, key=default_sort_key)
    [2, -I, I]

    The returned key can be used anywhere that a key can be specified for
    a function, e.g. sort, min, max, etc...:

    >>> a.sort(key=default_sort_key)
    >>> a[0]
    2
    >>> min(a, key=default_sort_key)
    2

    Notes
    =====

    The key returned is useful for getting items into a canonical order
    that will be the same across platforms. It is not directly useful for
    sorting lists of expressions:

    >>> a, b = x, 1/x

    Since ``a`` has only 1 term, its value of sort_key is unaffected by
    ``order``:

    >>> a.sort_key() == a.sort_key('rev-lex')
    True

    If ``a`` and ``b`` are combined then the key will differ because there
    are terms that can be ordered:

    >>> eq = a + b
    >>> eq.sort_key() == eq.sort_key('rev-lex')
    False
    >>> eq.as_ordered_terms()
    [x, 1/x]
    >>> eq.as_ordered_terms('rev-lex')
    [1/x, x]

    But since the keys for each of these terms are independent of ``order``'s
    value, they don't sort differently when they appear separately in a list:

    >>> sorted(eq.args, key=default_sort_key)
    [1/x, x]
    >>> sorted(eq.args, key=lambda i: default_sort_key(i, order='rev-lex'))
    [1/x, x]

    The order of terms obtained when using these keys is the order that would
    be obtained if those terms were *factors* in a product.

    Although it is useful for quickly putting expressions in canonical order,
    it does not sort expressions based on their complexity defined by the
    number of operations, power of variables and others:

    >>> sorted([sin(x)*cos(x), sin(x)], key=default_sort_key)
    [sin(x)*cos(x), sin(x)]
    >>> sorted([x, x**2, sqrt(x), x**3], key=default_sort_key)
    [sqrt(x), x, x**2, x**3]
