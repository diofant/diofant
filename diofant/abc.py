"""
This module exports all latin and greek letters as Symbols, so you can
conveniently do

    >>> from diofant.abc import x, y

instead of the slightly more clunky-looking

    >>> from diofant import symbols
    >>> x, y = symbols('x y')

Caveats
=======

1. As of the time of writing this, the names ``O``, ``S``, ``I``, ``N``,
   ``E``, and ``Q`` are colliding with names defined in Diofant. If you import
   them from both ``diofant.abc`` and ``diofant``, the second import will "win".
   This is an issue only for * imports, which should only be used for
   short-lived code such as interactive sessions and throwaway scripts that do
   not survive until the next Diofant upgrade, where ``diofant`` may contain a
   different set of names.

2. This module does not define symbol names on demand, i.e.
   ```from diofant.abc import foo``` will be reported as an error because
   ``diofant.abc`` does not contain the name ``foo``. To get a symbol named
   `'foo'`, you still need to use ``Symbol('foo')`` or ``symbols('foo')``.
   You can freely mix usage of ``diofant.abc`` and ``Symbol``/``symbols``, though
   sticking with one and only one way to get the symbols does tend to make the
   code more readable.

def clashing():
    """Return the clashing-symbols dictionaries.

    ``clash1`` defines all the single letter variables that clash with
    Diofant objects; ``clash2`` defines the multi-letter clashing symbols;
    and ``clash`` is the union of both. These can be passed for ``locals``
    during sympification if one desires Symbols rather than the non-Symbol
    objects for those names.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from diofant import sympify
    >>> from diofant.abc import _clash1, _clash2, _clash
    >>> sympify("Q & C", locals=_clash1)
    And(C, Q)
    >>> sympify('pi(x)', locals=_clash2)

    Note: if changes are made to the docstring examples they can only
    be tested after removing "clashing" from the list of deleted items
    at the bottom of this file which removes this function from the
    namespace.
