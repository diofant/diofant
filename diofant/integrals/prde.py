"""
Algorithms for solving Parametric Risch Differential Equations.

The methods used for solving Parametric Risch Differential Equations parallel
those for solving Risch Differential Equations.  See the outline in the
docstring of rde.py for more information.

The Parametric Risch Differential Equation problem is, given f, g1, ..., gm in
K(t), to determine if there exist y in K(t) and c1, ..., cm in Const(K) such
that Dy + f*y == Sum(ci*gi, (i, 1, m)), and to find such y and ci if they exist.

For the algorithms here G is a list of tuples of factions of the terms on the
right hand side of the equation (i.e., gi in k(t)), and Q is a list of terms on
the right hand side of the equation (i.e., qi in k[t]).  See the docstring of
each function for more information.

    a list of tuples such that Add(*[i*j for i, j in ans]) == u.  This is useful

    transcendental over C(x)(t_1, ..., t_i-1) and Dt_i = Da_i/a_i, for some a_i
    in C(x)(t_1, ..., t_i-1)* } (i.e., the set of all indices of logarithmic
    monomials of K over C(x)), and E_K/C(x) = { i in {1, ..., n} such that t_i

    a_i in C(x)(t_1, ..., t_i-1) } (i.e., the set of all indices of
    hyperexponential monomials of K over C(x)).  If K is an elementary extension
    over C(x), then the cardinality of L_K/C(x) U E_K/C(x) is exactly the
    transcendence degree of K over C(x).  Furthermore, because Const_D(K) ==
    Const_D(C(x)) == C, deg(Dt_i) == 1 when t_i is in E_K/C(x) and
    deg(Dt_i) == 0 when t_i is in L_K/C(x), implying in particular that E_K/C(x)
    and L_K/C(x) are disjoint.

    The sets L_K/C(x) and E_K/C(x) must, by their nature, be computed
    recursively using this same function.  Therefore, it is required to pass
    them as indices to D (or T).  E_args are the arguments of the
    hyperexponentials indexed by E_K (i.e., if i is in E_K, then T[i] ==
    exp(E_args[i])).  This is needed to compute the final answer u such that
    Df/f == Du.

    log(f) will be the same as u up to a additive constant.  This is because
    they will both behave the same as monomials. For example, both log(x) and
    log(2*x) == log(x) + log(2) satisfy Dt == 1/x, because log(2) is constant.
    Therefore, the term const is returned.  const is such that
    log(const) + f == u.  This is calculated by dividing the arguments of one
    logarithm from the other.  Therefore, it is necessary to pass the arguments
    of the logarithmic terms in L_args.
