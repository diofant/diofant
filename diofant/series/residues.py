def residue(expr, x, x0):
    """
    Finds the residue of ``expr`` at the point ``x=x0``.

    The residue is defined as the coefficient of `1/(x - x_0)`
    in the power series expansion around `x=x_0`.

    This notion is essential for the Residue Theorem.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> residue(1/x, x, 0)
    1
    >>> residue(1/x**2, x, 0)
    0
    >>> residue(2/sin(x), x, 0)
    2

    # the section 5.6 of the Bronstein's book {M. Bronstein:
    # Symbolic Integration I, Springer Verlag (2005)}. For purely
    # rational functions, the algorithm is much easier. See
    # sections 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7 (this section actually gives an
    # algorithm for computing any Laurent series coefficient for
    # a rational function). The theory in section 2.4 will help to
    # understand why the resultant works in the general algorithm.
    # For the definition of a resultant, see section 1.4 (and any
    # previous sections for more review).
