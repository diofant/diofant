def continued_fraction_periodic(p, q, d=0):
    r"""Find the periodic continued fraction expansion.

    Compute the continued fraction expansion of a rational or a
    quadratic surd, i.e. `\frac{p + \sqrt{d}}{q}`, where `p`, `q`
    and `d \ge 0` are integers.

    Returns
    =======

    list
        the continued fraction representation (canonical form) as a list of
        integers, optionally ending (for quadratic irrationals) with
        repeating block as the last term of this list.

    Parameters
    ==========

    p : int
        the rational part of the number's numerator
    q : int
        the denominator of the number
    d : int, optional
        the irrational part (discriminator) of the number's numerator

    Examples
    ========

    >>> continued_fraction_periodic(3, 2, 7)
    [2, [1, 4, 1, 1]]

    Golden ratio has the simplest continued fraction expansion:

    >>> continued_fraction_periodic(1, 2, 5)
    [[1]]

    If the discriminator is zero or a perfect square then the number will be a
    rational number:

    >>> continued_fraction_periodic(4, 3, 0)
    [1, 3]
    >>> continued_fraction_periodic(4, 3, 49)
    [3, 1, 2]

def continued_fraction_reduce(cf):
    """Reduce a continued fraction to a rational or quadratic irrational.

    Compute the rational or quadratic irrational number from its
    terminating or periodic continued fraction expansion.  The
    continued fraction expansion (cf) should be supplied as a
    terminating iterator supplying the terms of the expansion.  For
    terminating continued fractions, this is equivalent to
    ``list(continued_fraction_convergents(cf))[-1]``, only a little more
    efficient.  If the expansion has a repeating part, a list of the
    repeating terms should be returned as the last element from the
    iterator.  This is the format returned by
    continued_fraction_periodic.

    For quadratic irrationals, returns the largest solution found,
    which is generally the one sought, if the fraction is in canonical
    form (all terms positive except possibly the first).
