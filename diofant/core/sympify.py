    """Converts an arbitrary expression to a type that can be used inside Diofant.

    For example, it will convert Python ints into instance of diofant.Rational,
    floats into instances of diofant.Float, etc. It is also able to coerce symbolic
    expressions which inherit from Basic. This can be useful in cooperation
    with SAGE.

    It currently accepts as arguments:
       - any object defined in diofant
       - standard numeric python types: int, long, float, Decimal
       - strings (like "0.09" or "2e-19")
       - booleans, including ``None`` (will leave ``None`` unchanged)
       - lists, sets or tuples containing any of the above

    If the argument is already a type that Diofant understands, it will do
    nothing but return that value. This can be used at the beginning of a
    function to ensure you are working with the correct type.

    >>> sympify(2).is_integer
    True
    >>> sympify(2).is_real
    True

    >>> sympify(2.0).is_real
    True
    >>> sympify('2.0').is_real
    True
    >>> sympify('2e-45').is_real
    True

    If the expression could not be converted, a SympifyError is raised.

    >>> sympify('x***2')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    SympifyError: SympifyError: "could not parse u'x***2'"

    *Locals*

    The sympification happens with access to everything that is loaded
    by ``from diofant import *``; anything used in a string that is not
    defined by that import will be converted to a symbol. In the following,
    the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is
    interpreted as the Order object (used with series) and it raises
    an error when used improperly:

    >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'
    >>> sympify(s)
    bitcount(42)
    >>> sympify('O(x)')
    O(x)
    >>> sympify('O + 1')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: unbound method...

    In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a
    namespace dictionary and passed as locals:

    >>> ns = {}
    >>> exec('from diofant.core.evalf import bitcount', ns)
    >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)
    6

    In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such
    in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all
    three of the following are possibilities:

    >>> ns['O'] = Symbol('O')  # method 1
    >>> exec('from diofant.abc import O', ns)  # method 2
    >>> ns.update({O: Symbol('O')})  # method 3
    >>> sympify('O + 1', locals=ns)
    O + 1

    If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols
    then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined
    there as private variables: _clash1 (single-letter variables), _clash2
    (the multi-letter Greek names) or _clash (both single and multi-letter
    names that are defined in abc).

    >>> from diofant.abc import _clash1
    >>> _clash1
    {'E': E, 'I': I, 'N': N, 'O': O, 'S': S}
    >>> sympify('E & O', _clash1)
    E & O

    *Strict*

    If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an
    explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the other
    cases, a SympifyError is raised.

    >>> print(sympify(None))
    None
    >>> sympify(None, strict=True)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    SympifyError: SympifyError: None

    *Evaluation*

    If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and
    operators will be converted into their Diofant equivalents and the
    ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will
    be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces
    operators with their Diofant equivalents, so if an operand redefines any
    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used.

    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')
    19/3
    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)
    2**2/3 + 5

    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions
    that are very different in structure than what was entered.  Below you
    can see how an expression reduces to -1 by autosimplification, but does
    not do so when ``evaluate`` option is used.

    >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1
    -1
    >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'
    >>> sympify(s)
    -1
    >>> sympify(s, evaluate=False)
    -2*((x - 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1

    *Extending*

    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),
    just define a ``_diofant_`` method to your class. You can do that even to
    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.

    >>> class MyList1:
    ...     def __iter__(self):
    ...         yield 1
    ...         yield 2
    ...         return
    ...
    ...     def __getitem__(self, i):
    ...         return list(self)[i]
    ...
    ...     def _diofant_(self):
    ...         return Matrix(self)
    >>> sympify(MyList1())
    Matrix([
    [1],
    [2]])

    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the
    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a
    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired Diofant
    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.

    >>> class MyList2:   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!
    ...     def __iter__(self):  # Use _diofant_!
    ...         yield 1
    ...         yield 2
    ...         return
    ...
    ...     def __getitem__(self, i):
    ...         return list(self)[i]
    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)
    >>> sympify(MyList2())
    Matrix([
    [1],
    [2]])
