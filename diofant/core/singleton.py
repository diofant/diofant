class SingletonRegistry:
    """
    The registry for the singleton classes.

    Several classes in Diofant appear so often that they are
    singletonized, that is, using some metaprogramming they are made
    so that they can only be instantiated once (see the
    :class:`diofant.core.singleton.Singleton` class for details).  For
    instance, every time you create ``Integer(0)``, this will return
    the same instance, :class:`diofant.core.numbers.Zero`.

    >>> a = Integer(0)
    >>> a is S.Zero
    True

    All singleton instances are attributes of the
    :data:`~diofant.core.singleton.S` object, so ``Integer(0)`` can
    also be accessed as ``S.Zero``.

    Notes
    =====

    For the most part, the fact that certain objects are singletonized
    is an implementation detail that users shouldn't need to worry
    about.  In Diofant library code, :keyword:`is` comparison is often
    used for performance purposes.  The primary advantage of
    :data:`~diofant.core.singleton.S` for end users is the convenient
    access to certain instances that are otherwise difficult to type,
    like ``S.Half`` (instead of ``Rational(1, 2)``).

    When using ``is`` comparison, make sure the argument is a
    :class:`~diofant.core.basic.Basic` instance.  For example,

    >>> int(0) is S.Zero
    False

    Metaclass for singleton classes.

    A singleton class has only one instance which is returned every
    time the class is instantiated. Additionally, this instance can be
    accessed through the global registry object
    :data:`~diofant.core.singleton.S` as ``S.<class_name>``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> class MySingleton(Basic, metaclass=Singleton):
    ...     pass
    >>> Basic() is Basic()
    False
    >>> MySingleton() is MySingleton()
    True
    >>> S.MySingleton is MySingleton()
    True

    Notes
    =====

    Instance creation is delayed until the first time the value is accessed.

    This metaclass is a subclass of ManagedProperties because that is the
    metaclass of many classes that need to be Singletons (Python does not allow
    subclasses to have a different metaclass than the superclass, except the
    subclass may use a subclassed metaclass).
