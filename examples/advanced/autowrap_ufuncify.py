"""
Setup ufuncs for the legendre polynomials
-----------------------------------------

This example demonstrates how you can use the ufuncify utility in SymPy
to create fast, customized universal functions for use with numpy
arrays. An autowrapped sympy expression can be significantly faster than
what you would get by applying a sequence of the ufuncs shipped with
numpy. [0]

You need to have numpy installed to run this example, as well as a
working fortran compiler.
