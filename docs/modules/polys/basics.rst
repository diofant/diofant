Introduction
============

This tutorial tries to give an overview of the functionality concerning
polynomials within Diofant. All code examples assume::

    >>> init_printing(pretty_print=True, use_unicode=True, wrap_line=False, no_global=True)

Basic functionality
===================

These functions provide different algorithms dealing with polynomials in the
form of Diofant expression, like symbols, sums etc.

Division
--------

The function :func:`~diofant.polys.polytools.div` provides
division of polynomials with remainder.
That is, for polynomials ``f`` and ``g``, it computes ``q`` and ``r``, such
that `f = g \cdot q + r` and `\deg(r) < q`. For polynomials in one variables
with coefficients in a field, say, the rational numbers, ``q`` and ``r`` are
uniquely defined this way::

    >>> f = 5*x**2 + 10*x + 3
    >>> g = 2*x + 2

    >>> q, r = div(f, g, domain='QQ')
    >>> q
    5⋅x   5
    ─── + ─
     2    2
    >>> r
    -2
    >>> (q*g + r).expand()
       2
    5⋅x  + 10⋅x + 3

As you can see, ``q`` has a non-integer coefficient. If you want to do division
only in the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients, you can specify an
additional parameter::

    >>> q, r = div(f, g, domain='ZZ')
    >>> q
    0
    >>> r
       2
    5⋅x  + 10⋅x + 3

But be warned, that this ring is no longer Euclidean and that the degree of the
remainder doesn't need to be smaller than that of ``f``. Since 2 doesn't divide 5,
`2 x` doesn't divide `5 x^2`, even if the degree is smaller. But::

    >>> g = 5*x + 1

    >>> q, r = div(f, g, domain='ZZ')
    >>> q
    x
    >>> r
    9⋅x + 3
    >>> (q*g + r).expand()
       2
    5⋅x  + 10⋅x + 3

This also works for polynomials with multiple variables::

    >>> f = x*y + y*z
    >>> g = 3*x + 3*z

    >>> q, r = div(f, g, domain='QQ')
    >>> q
    y
    ─
    3
    >>> r
    0

In the last examples, all of the three variables ``x``, ``y`` and ``z`` are
assumed to be variables of the polynomials. But if you have some unrelated
constant as coefficient, you can specify the variables explicitly::

    >>> a, b, c = symbols('a b c')
    >>> f = a*x**2 + b*x + c
    >>> g = 3*x + 2
    >>> q, r = div(f, g, domain='QQ')
    >>> q
    a⋅x   2⋅a   b
    ─── - ─── + ─
     3     9    3

    >>> r
    4⋅a   2⋅b
    ─── - ─── + c
     9     3

GCD and LCM
-----------

With division, there is also the computation of the greatest common divisor and
the least common multiple.

When the polynomials have integer coefficients, the contents' gcd is also
considered::

    >>> f = (12*x + 12)*x
    >>> g = 16*x**2
    >>> gcd(f, g)
    4⋅x

But if the polynomials have rational coefficients, then the returned polynomial is
monic::

    >>> f = 3*x**2/2
    >>> g = 9*x/4
    >>> gcd(f, g)
    x

It also works with multiple variables. In this case, the variables are ordered
alphabetically, be default, which has influence on the leading coefficient::

    >>> f = x*y/2 + y**2
    >>> g = 3*x + 6*y

    >>> gcd(f, g)
    x + 2⋅y

The lcm is connected with the gcd and one can be computed using the other::

    >>> f = x*y**2 + x**2*y
    >>> g = x**2*y**2
    >>> gcd(f, g)
    x⋅y
    >>> lcm(f, g)
     3  2    2  3
    x ⋅y  + x ⋅y
    >>> (f*g).expand()
     4  3    3  4
    x ⋅y  + x ⋅y
    >>> (gcd(f, g, x, y)*lcm(f, g, x, y)).expand()
     4  3    3  4
    x ⋅y  + x ⋅y

Square-free factorization
-------------------------

The square-free factorization of a univariate polynomial is the product of all
factors (not necessarily irreducible) of degree 1, 2 etc.::

    >>> f = 2*x**2 + 5*x**3 + 4*x**4 + x**5

    >>> sqf_list(f)
    (1, [(x + 2, 1), (x, 2), (x + 1, 2)])

    >>> sqf(f)
     2        2
    x ⋅(x + 1) ⋅(x + 2)

Factorization
-------------

This function provides factorization of univariate and multivariate polynomials
with rational coefficients::

    >>> factor(x**4/2 + 5*x**3/12 - x**2/3)
     2
    x ⋅(2⋅x - 1)⋅(3⋅x + 4)
    ──────────────────────
              12

    >>> factor(x**2 + 4*x*y + 4*y**2)
             2
    (x + 2⋅y)

Gröbner bases
-------------

Buchberger's algorithm is implemented, supporting various monomial orders::

    >>> groebner([x**2 + 1, y**4*x + x**3], x, y, order='lex')
                 ⎛⎡ 2       4    ⎤                           ⎞
    GroebnerBasis⎝⎣x  + 1, y  - 1⎦, x, y, domain=ℤ, order=lex⎠


    >>> groebner([x**2 + 1, y**4*x + x**3, x*y*z**3], x, y, z, order='grevlex')
                 ⎛⎡ 4       3   2    ⎤                                  ⎞
    GroebnerBasis⎝⎣y  - 1, z , x  + 1⎦, x, y, z, domain=ℤ, order=grevlex⎠

Solving Equations
-----------------

We have (incomplete) methods to find the complex or even symbolic roots of
polynomials and to solve some systems of polynomial equations::

    >>> solve(x**3 + 2*x + 3, x)
    ⎡         ⎧         ____  ⎫  ⎧         ____  ⎫⎤
    ⎢         ⎪   1   ╲╱ 11 ⋅ⅈ⎪  ⎪   1   ╲╱ 11 ⋅ⅈ⎪⎥
    ⎢{x: -1}, ⎨x: ─ - ────────⎬, ⎨x: ─ + ────────⎬⎥
    ⎢         ⎪   2      2    ⎪  ⎪   2      2    ⎪⎥
    ⎣         ⎩               ⎭  ⎩               ⎭⎦

    >>> p = Symbol('p')
    >>> q = Symbol('q')

    >>> solve(x**2 + p*x + q, x)
    ⎡⎧            __________⎫  ⎧            __________⎫⎤
    ⎢⎪           ╱  2       ⎪  ⎪           ╱  2       ⎪⎥
    ⎢⎨     p   ╲╱  p  - 4⋅q ⎬  ⎨     p   ╲╱  p  - 4⋅q ⎬⎥
    ⎢⎪x: - ─ - ─────────────⎪, ⎪x: - ─ + ─────────────⎪⎥
    ⎣⎩     2         2      ⎭  ⎩     2         2      ⎭⎦

    >>> solve_poly_system([y - x, x - 5], x, y)
    [{x: 5, y: 5}]

    >>> solve_poly_system([y**2 - x**3 + 1, y*x], x, y)
    ⎡                                           ⎧           ___        ⎫  ⎧           ___        ⎫⎤
    ⎢                                           ⎪     1   ╲╱ 3 ⋅ⅈ      ⎪  ⎪     1   ╲╱ 3 ⋅ⅈ      ⎪⎥
    ⎢{x: 0, y: -ⅈ}, {x: 0, y: ⅈ}, {x: 1, y: 0}, ⎨x: - ─ - ───────, y: 0⎬, ⎨x: - ─ + ───────, y: 0⎬⎥
    ⎢                                           ⎪     2      2         ⎪  ⎪     2      2         ⎪⎥
    ⎣                                           ⎩                      ⎭  ⎩                      ⎭⎦
