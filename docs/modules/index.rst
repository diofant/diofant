.. module:: diofant

Because every feature of Diofant must have a test case, when you are not sure how
to use something, just look into the ``tests/`` directories, find that feature
and read the tests for it, that will tell you everything you need to know.

Most of the things are already documented though in this document, that is
automatically generated using Diofant's docstrings.

Click the  "modules" (:ref:`modindex`) link in the top right corner to easily
access any Diofant module, or use this contens:
