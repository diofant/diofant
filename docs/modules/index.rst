.. module:: diofant

Most of the things are already documented though in this document, that is
automatically generated using Diofant's docstrings.

.. tip::

    Because every feature of Diofant must have a test case, when you are not
    sure how to use something, just look into the ``tests`` subdirectories,
    find that feature and read the tests for it.

.. warning::

    The Diofant project is in the early stage of developement and has no
    stable API yet.
