Immutable Matrices
==================

The standard Matrix class in SymPy is mutable. This is important for
performance reasons but means that standard matrices can not interact well with
the rest of SymPy. This is because the :class:`~sympy.core.basic.Basic` object, from which most
SymPy classes inherit, is immutable.

The mission of the :class:`~sympy.matrices.immutable.ImmutableMatrix` class is to bridge the tension
between performance/mutability and safety/immutability. Immutable matrices can
do almost everything that normal matrices can do but they inherit from
:class:`~sympy.core.basic.Basic` and can thus interact more naturally with the rest of SymPy.
:class:`~sympy.matrices.immutable.ImmutableMatrix` also inherits from :class:`~sympy.matrices.expressions.MatrixExpr`, allowing it to
interact freely with SymPy's Matrix Expression module.

You can turn any Matrix-like object into an :class:`~sympy.matrices.immutable.ImmutableMatrix` by calling
the constructor

    >>> from sympy import Matrix, ImmutableMatrix
    >>> M = Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> M[1, 1] = 0
    >>> IM = ImmutableMatrix(M)
    >>> IM
    Matrix([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 0, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> IM[1, 1] = 5
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: Can not set values in Immutable Matrix. Use Matrix instead.
