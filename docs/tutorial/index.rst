Tutorial

.. warning::

    It assumed that the reader already knows the Python programming language.
    If you do not, please start from the `official Python tutorial
    <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_.

This tutorial aims to give an introduction to Diofant for someone who has not
used the library before.  Many features will be introduced in this tutorial,
but they will not be exhaustive. In fact, virtually every functionality shown
here will have more options or capabilities than what will be shown.  The rest
of documentation serves as API documentation, which extensively lists every
feature and option of each function.

.. These are the goals of this tutorial:

   - To give a guide, suitable for someone who has never used Diofant (but who
     has used Python and knows the necessary mathematics).

   - To be written in a narrative format, which is both easy and fun to follow.
     It should read like a book.

   - To give insightful examples and exercises, to help the reader learn and to
     make it entertaining to work through.

   - To introduce concepts in a logical order.

   - To use good practices and idioms, and avoid antipatterns.  Functions or
     methodologies that tend to lead to antipatterns are avoided. Features that
     are only useful to advanced users are not shown.

   - To be consistent.  If there are multiple ways to do it, only the best way
     is shown.  For example, there are at least five different ways to create
     Symbols.  ``symbols`` is the only one that is general and doesn't lead to
     antipatterns, so it is the only one used.

   - To avoid unnecessary duplication, it is assumed that previous sections of
     the tutorial have already been read.
